# Technical Documentation for SmartBuildEco

## Architecture

SmartBuildEco is built using a microservices architecture, with each feature (property valuation, predictive maintenance, energy efficiency, and climate resilience) running as a separate service. The services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs.

### Components

* **Frontend**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the platform
* **Backend**: A set of microservices that provide the core functionality of the platform
* **Database**: A PostgreSQL database that stores data for the platform
* **API Gateway**: A reverse proxy that routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice

### Technology Stack

* **Python 3.9.5**: The primary programming language used for the platform
* **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used for building the microservices
* **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system used for storing data
* **Docker**: A containerization platform used for deploying the microservices

## Design

SmartBuildEco is designed to be scalable, flexible, and maintainable. Eachmicroservice is designed to be independent and self-contained, with its own database and API. This allows for easy scaling and maintenance of the platform.

### API Design

The APIs for SmartBuildEco are designed using RESTful principles, with each endpoint representing a resource. The APIs use JSON as the primary data format, and support HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Database Design

The database for SmartBuildEco is designed using a relational model, with each table representing a resource. The database is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Implementation

SmartBuildEco is implemented using Python and Flask, with each microservice running as a separate Flask application. The microservices communicate with each other using RESTful APIs, and with the database using SQLAlchemy.

### Deployment

SmartBuildEco is deployed using Docker, with each microservice running as a separate Docker container. The containers are orchestrated using Docker Compose, and are deployed to a cloud-based platform such as AWS or Google Cloud.
