Oracle Networks Architecture
=============================

The SmartBuildEco blockchain oracle network consists of the following components:

1. **Oracle Node**: responsible for processing blocks and sending transactions to the blockchain
2. **Smart Contract**: responsible for managing the oracle network and node balances
3. **Frontend Interface**: responsible for interacting with the oracle network and displaying node balances and transaction history

The oracle node communicates with the smart contract to process blocks and send transactions. The frontend interface communicates with the oracle node to retrieve node balances and transaction history.

The architecture is designed to be scalable and decentralized, allowing for multiple oracle nodes to be added to the network.

Components
------------

### Oracle Node

* Processes blocks and sends transactions to the blockchain
* Communicates with the smart contract to retrieve node balances and transaction history

### Smart Contract

* Manages the oracle network and node balances
* Processes transactions and updates node balances

### Frontend Interface

* Interacts with the oracle node to retrieve node balances and transaction history
* Displays node balances and transaction history to the user

Benefits
--------

* Decentralized and scalable architecture
* Secure and transparent transaction processing
* Real-time node balance and transaction history updates

Conclusion
----------

The SmartBuildEco blockchain oracle network provides a decentralized and scalable solution for processing transactions and managing node balances. The architecture is designed to be secure, transparent, and efficient, making it an ideal solution for the SmartBuildEco project.
